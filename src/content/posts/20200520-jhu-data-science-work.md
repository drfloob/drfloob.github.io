In 2016 I completed, then mentored for, the [Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization][jhu-course] on Coursera. My project work was pretty interesting, and resulted in some fun Rpubs.

* [The Costliest and Most Harmful Extreme Weather Events of the Past 65 Years](http://rpubs.com/aj_heller/severe_weather_costs)
* [Investigating the Central Limit Theorem through Simulation](http://rpubs.com/aj_heller/SimulationsAndTheCLT)
* [Exploring the Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs](http://rpubs.com/aj_heller/ToothGrowthAndVitaminC)
* [Quality of Movement Classification](https://drfloob.github.io/QualityOfMovementClassification/QualityOfMovementAnalysis.html)
